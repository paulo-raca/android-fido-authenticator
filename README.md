Android FIDO2 Authenticator
===========================

FIDO2 authenticators are still a novelty: They aren't all that cheap, can only store a very small number of persisted keys (Necessary for single-factor), have minimalistic user interfaces and most of the time aren't hardened by biometrics/pins.

Android has all the hardware goodies to be an excellent FIDO2 authenticator.

This project aims to implement CTAP2 over BLE and NFC.
